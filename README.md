# Predicting Stock Market Entry and Exit Points

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to the development and analysis of a model designed to predict optimal entry and exit points in the stock market using candlestick patterns and technical indicators. The goal is to maximize trading profits by identifying high-probability buy and sell opportunities.

## Background
The project leverages historical stock price data, focusing on technical analysis tools such as candlestick patterns and indicators like Moving Averages, RSI, and MACD. These tools are crucial in pinpointing market trends and making informed trading decisions.

## Data
Data is sourced from:
- Yahoo Finance
- Investing.com
- Google Finance

This includes Open, High, Low, Close (OHLC) and volume data of stocks, particularly focusing on highly active stocks to ensure relevance to current market conditions.

## Methods
### Data Collection
- Automated scripts for web scraping and API calls to gather real-time and historical data.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analysis of candlestick formations and technical indicators to identify bullish and bearish trends.
### Feature Engineering
- Processing data to form features suitable for machine learning.
### Machine Learning
- Use of a Random Forest classifier to predict market trends based on the defined features.

## Comprehensive Technical Analysis of Stocks: Trend Identification and Momentum Insights

### Momentum Signals
- Analysis of volume and price performance over three-day periods to identify market traction and buying pressure.

### Technical Indicators
- **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** Assesses overbought (above 70) or oversold (below 30) conditions to suggest potential price reversals.
- **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):** Identifies changes in market momentum and direction through moving averages.
- **MA Crossover:** Signals bullish or bearish trends based on the crossover of short-term and long-term moving averages.

### Candlestick Pattern Analysis
- Fundamental techniques predicting future price movements based on historical patterns like Morning Star (bullish) and Evening Star (bearish).

### Risk Management
- Implementation of stop loss to manage risks and limit potential losses effectively.

### Combining Indicators
- Utilization of RSI, MACD, and MA crossovers alongside candlestick patterns to make informed trading decisions.

## Results
Initial tests show promising results in predicting entry and exit points, which could significantly impact trading profitability. However, concerns about model overfitting are addressed by ongoing adjustments and testing.

## Ethical Considerations
Attention is given to ethical concerns such as market manipulation and ensuring data integrity. The model aims to support trading decisions based on transparent and robust analysis.

## Contribution
Contributions to enhance the model's accuracy or expand its capabilities are welcome. Please feel free to fork this repo, submit pull requests, or open issues for discussion.
